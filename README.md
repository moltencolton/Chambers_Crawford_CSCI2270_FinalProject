# C++ Quote Verifier 

This project uses [Wikiquote](https://www.wikiquote.org/) to allow the user to get the quotes of various people. This is accomplished by using cURL to get the HTML of the Wikiquote page for that person and then parsing the quotes into a usable format. Once these quotes have been parsed out, they are stored in a binary search tree for easy searching. This will be useful, as it will allow the user to then check if quotes they find online for this person are verified, or if they could be made up.

The program is ran by entering in the quote that you want to be verified then the program prints whether it is a fake quote or if it is real. If it is real it will also tell you if is the correct author or not.
