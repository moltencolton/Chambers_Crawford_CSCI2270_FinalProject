# C++ Quote Verifier 

This project uses [Wikiquote](https://www.wikiquote.org/) to allow the user to get the quotes of various people. This is accomplished by using cURL to get the HTML of the Wikiquote page for that person and then parsing the quotes into a usable format. Once these quotes have been parsed out, they are stored in a binary search tree for easy searching. This will be useful, as it will allow the user to then check if quotes they find online for this person are verified, or if they could be made up.
